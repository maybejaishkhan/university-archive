### 1.1. The Entrepreneurial Process
It is a systematic, iterative sequence of steps to create, develop, and manage a new venture, overcoming resistance to innovation. It consists of 4 phases:

1. **Opportunity Identification and Evaluation** --> The foundation of entrepreneurship, focusing on recognizing and assessing viable opportunities. It distinguishes a mere idea from a market-driven, value-creating opportunity.
	- Identify opportunities by staying alert to market needs or consumer feedback.
	- Evaluate opportunities based on durability, value, risks, returns, personal fit, and competitive uniqueness.
	- Create an **Opportunity Assessment Plan** to validate the opportunity before planning.

2. **Development of Business Plan** --> Crafting a detailed plan to exploit the validated opportunity. It is essential for resource acquisition and guiding venture management. However, it is time-consuming, especially for inexperienced entrepreneurs with limited resources.
	- Create a proper business plan with products/services, market analysis, strategy, management, marketing, HR, and multi-year financial projections.

3. **Determination of Required Resources** --> Securing the resources needed to launch and sustain the venture. It ensures timely resource availability to execute the business plan.
	- Assess current resources and distinguish critical from helpful ones.
    - Acquire resources (e.g., capital, human resources) while minimizing loss of ownership.
    - Identify alternative resource suppliers, potentially relinquishing some control for growth funding.

4. **Management of the Resulting Enterprise** --> Implementing the plan and managing the venture for growth and success. It drives the venture toward sustainability and success but some entrepreneurs do struggle with managing growth despite successful startup.
    - Execute the business plan using acquired resources.
    - Establish a management style, structure, and control system to address operational challenges.
    - Identify key success variables and resolve issues quickly.

> [!note] Business Opportunity
> A market-driven situation with potential demand, addressing a specific need through a new product, service, or business.
> - **Essential Qualities** --> Attractive, Timely, Durable and Value-Adding.

> [!quote] Theoretical Perspectives
> 1. Discovery (Kirznerian)
> 	- Opportunities exist externally due to market imbalances.
> 	- An alert entrepreneur identifies and exploits existing opportunities, seeking equilibrium.
> 2. Creation (Schumpeterian)
> 	- Opportunities are created through innovation.
> 	- Innovator introduces new products/methods, disrupting markets.

> [!bug] Intellectual Property
> Protecting intellectual property is crucial for entrepreneurs, as it prevents others from copying innovations and gives the business a competitive advantage. 
> 1. **Patents** --- A government-given right that protects unique processes.
> 2. **Trade Secrets** --- knowledge that is kept secret for the purpose of gaining a business advantage over competitors like Coca Cola's formula.
> 3. **Trademarks** --- Protects any word, symbol, or combination used on goods.
> 4. **Copyright** --- Covers literary and artistic works, film, photographs, and software.

## 2. Business Plan
> An important document in the entrepreneurial process, usually made after an opportunity has been identified and evaluated. It is a time-consuming phase that is essential for exploiting the defined opportunity, determining and obtaining the required resources, and successfully managing the resulting venture.

A typical Business Plan includes these major headings:
1. **Table of Content (TOC)**
2. **Project Team Members and Leads**

9. **Strategic Product Roadmap** --> Describes the long-term solution or product strategy for the next 3–5 years. This includes plans for fundraising and product/solution feature development.
10. **Implementation Timeline**
11. **Risk Factors** --> What could go wrong and how you would take care of it.

## 3. Lean Canvas
> A strategic tool designed for startup founders to mitigate the risk and uncertainty associated with the inception of a product. It serves as a method to help verify a product idea _before_ investing a lot of time and effort into shaping a comprehensive business plan.
### 3.1. Components
1. **Problem** --> The top three problems that your product is meant to solve for the customer. Also your closest competitors that are already solving the specified problems.
2. **Solution** --> Your top three features. It should explain the experience the customers are meant to have.
3. **Customer Segments** --> Your target customers. It is important to know your customer segment as accurately as possible.
4. **Unique Value Proposition** (UVP) / **Unique Selling Point** (USP) --> A single, clear message that says why your product is different and worth paying attention to. You must describe the uniqueness of your product and show its main difference from alternatives.
5. **Channels** --> The communication channels used to reach out to your target audience.
6. **Key Metrics** --> The key metrics that you measure to define the success/progress of the business.
7. **Revenue Streams** --> The ways your product will generate revenue from each customer segment. This includes the **revenue model**, **life time value (LTV)**, total **revenue**, and **gross margin**. 
8. **Cost Structure** --> The costs associated with running the business. Includes Customer Acquisition costs, Distribution costs, Hosting, and People, among others. List both fixed and variable costs.

## 4. Johari Window Model
> An assessment tool used to explore an individual's self-awareness and how they perceive, and are perceived by, others. It has 4 cells (or quadrants) based on whether information about a person is known or unknown to themselves and others. This includes strengths and weaknesses.

|                       | **Known to Self** | **Unknown to Self** |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Known to Others**   | Open Information  | Blind Spot          |
| **Unknown to Others** | Hidden / Facade   | Unknown Area        |

1. **Known to Self and Known to Others** --- "I know about myself and others know".
2. **Known to Self and Unknown to Others** --- "I know about myself but others don’t know".
3. **Unknown to Self and Known to Others** --- "I don’t know about myself but others seem to know"**.
4. **Unknown to Self and Unknown to Others** --- "neither I nor others know about me"**.

## 5. Emotional Intelligence
> An important quality for effective leadership and successful teamwork, especially within a startup environment. It has key competencies that separate truly effective leaders. 

There are 5 core competencies:
1. **Self-awareness** --> The ability to recognize what you are feeling and understand your emotional responses to things. It allows a person to see how their emotions affect their behavior and performance. When you are self-aware, you see yourself as others see you and have a good sense of your abilities and current limitations.
2. **Managing Emotions** --> The ability to stay focused and think clearly, even when having powerful emotions. Being able to manage your emotional state is essential for taking responsibility for your actions and can prevent decisions that you might later regret.
3. **Motivating Oneself** --> The ability to use your deepest emotions to move and guide you toward your goals. It enables a person to take initiative and persevere when facing obstacles and setbacks.
4. **Empathy** --> The ability to sense, understand, and respond to what other people are feeling. Self-awareness is required for empathy, as without it, you will not be able to read the emotions of others.
5. **Social Skill** --> The ability to manage, influence, and inspire emotions in others. Also, the ability to handle emotions in relationships and to influence others are important skills for leadership and teamwork.

> [!info] Assessing Emotional Intelligence
> A self-assessment questionnaire can be used to evaluate an individual's emotional competency by scoring statements based on how often they apply (1 = Does not apply at all; 3 = Applies about half the time; 5 = Always applies). The statements are grouped to measure performance in the five competency areas (Self-awareness, Managing emotions, Motivating oneself, Empathy, Social Skill).
> 
> The results of the assessment are interpreted using scoring ranges:
> - **35–50:** This area is a strength.
> - **18–34:** Giving attention to where the person feels weakest.
> - **10–17:** This area should be made a development priority.

## 6. Building the Startup Team
> It is important for success, as a startup's effectiveness depends largely on its team. The strength of the team can enable an idea to be turned into a scalable business, and a strong team can pivot and adapt when challenges arise.

> - **Managing Stress** --- Managing stress and burnout through work-life balance is necessary.
> - **Motivation** --- Maintaining motivation during uncertainty is a challenge that must be addressed.
> - **Reflection** --- Regular reflection and team-building exercises are beneficial.

## 7. Pitching an Impressive Idea

### 9.2. Questions based on given case (less likely)

> [!question] Example Case 1: QuickWash
> **Background:** A young entrepreneur, Sarah, noticed that university students hate doing laundry and often let clothes pile up, leading to wasted time and poor hygiene. Existing laundromats were decentralized and required students to physically carry heavy bags. Sarah decided to create **QuickWash**, a mobile app service.
> 
> **The Concept:** The QuickWash app allows students to schedule a pickup and delivery time directly from their dorm room. The clothes are picked up by a vetted driver, taken to a central commercial laundry facility, and returned clean and folded within 24 hours.
> 
> **Initial Challenges:** Sarah had no prior tech experience and had a small budget. Her first version of the app was an inexpensive third-party white-label solution, meaning it was buggy, crashed frequently during peak hours (Sunday evening), and didn't integrate with her drivers' routing software. The drivers were using paper manifests, which led to missed pickups and wrong deliveries. Student customers were complaining on social media about the poor reliability, directly impacting sign-ups.
> 
> **The Decision:** Sarah needs to decide whether to continue fixing the current platform with band-aid solutions or invest a significant amount of capital into building a custom, proprietary app and backend system from scratch.

1. OPPORTUNITY (Market & Value Proposition) --> Strong and well-identified, providing the initial basis for the venture.
	- **Problem Identification (Pain Point)** --- Sarah correctly identified a significant pain point: **time poverty** and **inconvenience** for university students who hate doing laundry.
	- **Customer Value** --- The value proposition is clear: reliability and convenience. Students are willing to pay a premium to outsource the time-consuming logistics of carrying, washing, and folding clothes.
	- **Market Size** --- The student market is large, concentrated, and high-volume, offering substantial scalability.
	- **Analysis** --- The Opportunity is robust. The venture's failure is not due to a lack of market need, but the inability of the **Resources** to service that need reliably.
2. RESOURCES (Technology & Capital) --> The weakest component of this venture and the root cause of the current crisis.
	- **Initial Flaw:** Sarah chose an inexpensive **white-label app** as her core technology resource. While this was a great strategy for a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to test the market, it proved to be a flawed resource for a scalable business.
	- **Inadequate Technology Stack:** The app's inability to integrate with the drivers' routing software means the most critical resource (the **logistics system**) is broken. The manual, paper-based manifests introduce severe **operational inefficiency** and **error.**
	- **Financial Impact:** The frequent app crashes and service failures lead to high **customer churn** and a high **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**, consuming the financial resources necessary for growth.
	- **Analysis:** The Resources component is **unbalanced**. Sarah must immediately commit significant new **capital** (a resource) to acquire the right **technology infrastructure** (a resource) to meet the opportunity's demand.
3. TEAM (Leadership & Skill Mix) --> The quality of the **Team** (Sarah's leadership) will determine if the venture can survive the resource crisis.
	- **Skill Gap:** Sarah, lacking prior tech experience, made the classic entrepreneurial mistake of underestimating the core technological needs of an **"App-First"** business model. This represents a **skill gap** in the initial team mix.
	- **Leadership Test:** Sarah's decision now is the ultimate test of her entrepreneurial leadership. She must recognize that the **technology _is_ the competitive advantage** in this market.
	- **Required Action:** To rebalance the model, Sarah must:
	    1. **Pivot:** Abandon the faulty white-label system.
	    2. **Recruit:** Actively hire or partner with a technical co-founder or a high-quality development team (a new **Team Resource**) to build the custom proprietary platform.
	    3. **Secure Funding:** Use the proven market traction (the Opportunity) to secure the necessary investment (new **Financial Resource**) for the custom build.

In Conclusion, QuickWash must invest heavily to balance the Resources component. The current model is failing because the high-demand **Opportunity** is crushing the inadequate **Resources**, and the **Team** is struggling to adapt.
